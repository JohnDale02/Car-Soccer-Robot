# I have changed the PyPS4Controller package to comment out some of the buttons we are not using...Hoping to save some time by not processing certain un-used events. Not sure if that will help but because I did that I have also included the controller.py file that I edited in the package. The goal for the controls is to have...
- Left joystick controls vertical movement (Forward and Backwards)
- Right joystick controls turning (Left and Right)
- Can get Controller input, but do not have ROS code to allow for this input to have meaningful movement.
